## Yata CLI

Yata is a command line task manager that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The idea for it came because I was frustrated with the other 
alternatives I found and I really only wanted a simple task manager. I really wanted git, but for tasks. This is what yata wants to be.

Yata is currently in pre-release, but soon there should be a viable alpha ready for using. You can see ROADMAP to get an idea for 
functionality before this README gets updated with the alpha version features.
